## Dependencies and Set-Up
It is possible to work with normal testnets (Rinkeby, Mumbai, etc).

In this case are going to run our own local blockchain to do it faster. 

To do show:

- Install hardhat-simple-storage from Patrick:
```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-simple-storage
cd hardhat-simple-storage

```bash
yarn hardhat node
```

Remember: Reset MetaMask account each time you are working with a new project in local Blockchain.
